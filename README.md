# Cost of light
Cost of light is a small Unity-based videogame that started as a semestral assignment. Your goal in this game is to find your way out of a cursed forest by defeating monsters and avoiding abandoned traps.  

You can use an old lantern to light your way and help you with timing the attacks. However, its fuel is limited and the only resource that can replace it is your health.
